# Frontend assessment project

Hello!
This is my version of the Spacious App.
I tried to complete all the project requirements in the short time I had available to develop it.

Everything was pretty clear to me, unless the optional 'friendships' task, I couldn't find it in the given README.

This was my first time using graphql and styled-components. It's been fun and I learnt a lot thanks to this app. I took a lot of care trying to replicate the given design but I didn't have time (I have some family stuff going on) to make it responsive and to write the tests. I am aware that I could have done more but the time for me was limited.


## Scripts


In order to start the containers, run the following in a terminal:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

In order to install the modules and start the project, run the following in the project directory:

```sh
$ npm start
```
